## Technical Architecture

### Mobile App (Flutter)

-   BLoC pattern for state management
-   File handling and processing
-   Real-time communication with backend

### Backend Server (Node.js/TypeScript)

-   OpenAI integration
-   Pinecone vector database
-   Multi-agent system using Langgraph
-   Document processing pipeline

## Prerequisites

-   Flutter SDK (>=3.4.3)
-   Node.js (Latest LTS version)
-   OpenAI API Key
-   Pinecone API Key and Index

## Installation

### Mobile App Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone 
```

2. Navigate to the mobile app directory:

```bash
cd 
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd 
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server root with the following variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME="YOUR_PINECONE_INDEX_NAME"
```
5. Start the server:

```bash
npx tsx server.ts
```

6. Update the server URL in the Flutter app:
    - Open `mobile/lib/services/api_service.dart`
    - Update the `baseUrl` to match your server address
